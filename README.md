# Data-Bank-Analysis-Project
The Data Bank Analysis Project focuses on leveraging SQL to extract actionable insights from complex customer and transaction datasets. This project involved creating a structured database with three primary tables: customer_nodes, which captures customer, region, and node data along with activity durations; customer_transactions, which stores detailed transaction information such as type and amount; and regions, which maps region IDs to their respective names. This foundational setup enabled comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and transaction patterns.

Key Insights and Queries:
A series of SQL queries were employed to derive meaningful insights from the data. The first query counted the total number of unique nodes across customer networks, providing a clear view of the network's breadth. Next, the distribution of nodes by region was analyzed, revealing which areas exhibited higher node activityâ€”insights that are critical for strategic resource allocation. The project further assessed customer engagement by calculating the unique customer count per region, identifying regions with high levels of interaction that could benefit from targeted marketing campaigns.
In terms of financial analysis, the total transaction amounts were summed by region, highlighting which regions contributed most significantly to overall transaction volumes. Additionally, the average activity duration of customers within nodes was calculated, offering insights into customer engagement lifecycles. The analysis also included a breakdown of transaction types, revealing which types dominated customer activity and guiding future business strategies.

Advanced Insights:
The project delved deeper into specific metrics such as deposit behaviors, analyzing average deposit counts and transaction amounts per customer. This information is vital for shaping financial strategies and enhancing customer retention efforts. Monthly transaction patterns were also examined, focusing on customers who made multiple deposits alongside single purchases or withdrawals each month. This analysis helped identify behavioral trends that could inform forecasting and tailored offers.
Using advanced SQL JOIN operations, the project linked region, node, and transaction data to create a holistic view of customer interactions. For example, it was found that Africa had the highest node activity while Europe led in total transaction volume.
